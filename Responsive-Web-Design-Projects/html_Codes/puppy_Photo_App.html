        Meowwww loved it, hated it, loved it, hated it yet spill litter box,
        scratch at owner, destroy all furniture, especially couch or lay on arms
        while you're using the keyboard. Missing until dinner time toy mouse
        squeak roll over. With tail in the air lounge in doorway. Man running
        from cops stops to pet cats, goes to jail.
